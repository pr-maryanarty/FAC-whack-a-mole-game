# How to play: 
To start a game press "start game". You will hear a sound of a starting game. Whack a mole, by clicking on it, be precise, and keep up, there 3 levels of difficulty. The speed of spawning of the characters increases the higher score you get. 
While creating this 8-bit-themed whack-a-mole game, javascript was used to set the game board by editing DOM elements; mole, and skeleton positioned randomly. 

There is a scoring system - but you can't win. Your highest score is your medal of honor. You can lose, though. Try to avoid the skeletons.
